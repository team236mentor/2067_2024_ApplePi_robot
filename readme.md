## Clone this repo to your desktop
The following steps will authorize vscode to access your github account through OAuth.
This is in place of setting up ssh keys. If you'd rather do that, feel free to do so.     
Similar steps to what we're doing [are covered here](https://adamtheautomator.com/visual-studio-code-github-setup/#Cloning_a_GitHub_Repository) if the below isn't clear enough.

  * Open the `2024 WPILib VS Code` link (on your desktop?)
  * Click the `Source Control` tab on the right ( Ctrl+Shift+G )
  * Click the `Clone Repository` button 
    * This will open the `Command Palette` at the top middle.   
      You will come to know this VS Code feature well...
    * Click the `Clone from GitHub` option
    * Follow the on-screen steps to authorize vscode to access your github account
  * Choose the `applepi-2067/2024_Robot` project

  * Choose a directory to clone the project into that you will remember (e.g. Documents\FRC\)
    a new subdirectory for the project will be created

  * The first time the project opens it should start downloading dependencies and building the code. 
    You should see the status of the build process listed at the bottom `Terminal` panel in vscode
    * If the build fails, you may not have completed the installation of the Phoenix Framework Installer (above).
